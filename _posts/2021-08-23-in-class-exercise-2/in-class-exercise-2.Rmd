```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Getting Started

This code chunk performs 3 tasks: <br>
* Create a list of R packages needed.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
packages <- c('sf', 'tidyverse')
for (p in packages){
  if (!require(p, character.only = T)) {
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}

```


## Test
``` {r}
print("test")
```
